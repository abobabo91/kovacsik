* the current version feels a bit mixed between startup and thesis. if we wanna give this to target customers soon we should only include value-add startup-focused stuff. i.e. pick which columns are useful, rename them, etc.
* I'll think about a more fitting line than "enter your investment thesis and discover matching startups" - this is more VC lingo
* make sure every company has a description, there are some gaps now where it's missing on tracxn
